Here's a simple method to manage React to-do list---

1.Prioritize Tasks: Once you have all your tasks listed, prioritize them based on urgency and importance. You can use methods like the Eisenhower Matrix (which categorizes tasks into quadrants based on urgency and importance) or simply assign each task a priority level (high, medium, low).

2.Break Down Tasks: If any tasks seem too large or overwhelming, break them down into smaller, more manageable subtasks. This can make them easier to tackle and help you make progress more quickly.

3.Organize Tasks: Group related tasks together or organize them by project or deadline. You can use categories, tags, or color-coding to keep track of different types of tasks.

4.Set Deadlines: Assign deadlines to your tasks to create a sense of urgency and help you stay on track. Be realistic about how much time each task will take, and consider any external deadlines or dependencies.

5.Schedule Tasks: Once you've prioritized and organized your tasks, schedule them into your calendar or planner. Block out time for each task based on its priority and deadline, and try to stick to your schedule as much as possible.

6.Review and Update Regularly: Review your to-do list regularly to make sure you're on track and adjust your priorities or deadlines as needed. Add new tasks as they come up, and mark off tasks as you complete them to keep your list up to date.

7.Stay Flexible: Be prepared to adapt and adjust your to-do list as circumstances change. Sometimes unexpected things come up, and you may need to rearrange your priorities or revise your plans accordingly.
